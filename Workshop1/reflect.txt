This workshop was a good way of refreshing my memory of generic c++ conventions, rule of three, read, and display functions
after a long summer break. The new concept of static variables where a variables value is persistant and accessible within its
scope is very useful and pretty easy to use. However, extern variables, though very similar aside from being file scope, 
gave me issues for a while as I decalred them in my header file and had linking issues until i realized that i need to define
them in my cpp file for the linking issues to resolve. Recieveing arguments from the command line in my main function was 
straightforward. Finally, part 2 of the workshop required the use of dynamic memeory allocation which was useful in brushing 
up on as i had become rusty.
